# CS495 Energy Environment App
This is a project for Seinor Capstone, with the idea of implementing an app in Java that allows for CRUD applications for ease of querying data and inputing new data.


## Base Idea
The base is to have a java app that allows for input data and search with in the data. Given the data will be saved via a Database (either AWS or locally hosted). Currently the database will be locally hosted since for testing and debugging it wont be the easiest with AWS.
